These effects apply whether you are using the instrument as the source of the spell or as a spellcasting focus. You can concentrate on spells cast from this instrument separately from spells you know, and you make separate concentration checks for each spell you are concentrating on.

Affected creatures may make another saving throw against this effect at the end of each of their turns."
