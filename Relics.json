The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC. Spells you cast that do no damage and have hindering effects do not affect your allies (unless you want them to) and have +2 to their DC. These effects apply whether you are using the instrument as the source of the spell or as a spellcasting focus. You can concentrate on spells cast from this instrument separately from spells you know, and you make separate concentration checks for each spell you are concentrating on. If you are concentrating on a spell from this instrument and end your turn without the instrument in your possession, you lose concentration on that spell."
